/** UbloxATCellularInterface class.
 *
 *  This uses the cellular-tuned IP stack that
 *  is on-board the cellular modem instead of the
 *  LWIP stack on the mbed MCU.
 *
 *  There are three advantages to using this mechanism:
 *
 *  1.  Since the modem interface remains in AT mode
 *      throughout, it is possible to continue using
 *      any AT commands (e.g. send SMS, use the module's
 *      file system, etc.) while the connection is up.
 *
 *  2.  The UbloxATCellularInterfaceExt class can
 *      be used to perform very simple HTTP and FTP
 *      operations using the modem's on-board clients.
 *
 *  3.  LWIP is not required (and hence RAM is saved).
 *
 *  The disadvantage is that some additional parsing
 *  (at the AT interface) has to go on in order to exchange
 *  IP packets, so this is less efficient under heavy loads.
 *  Also TCP Server and getting/setting of socket options is
 *  currently not supported.
